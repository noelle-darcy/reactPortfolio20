      <div id="biography">
        <p>How I got into coding: I started college in 2018 through FAU High's accelerated program which allowed me to be fully enrolled into college when I was 15. During my freshman year of highschool, I joined Science Olympiad to hang out with my friends so much and didn't realize how much it would change my life. 
          Even though I had applied for science-based competitions, I ended up being assigned to a competition where I had to build a working model helicopter with balsa wood, rubber bands and mylar. Thankfully, my competitive nature set in even though I didn't want to be apart of this competition and I put several hours a night into building, 
          perfecting and testing my helicopter. On the day of the competition, I was terrified that my hard work wasn't going to pay off. I was so scared that after I launched my helicopter, I instantly closed my eyes. I had no idea what was happening until I heard everyone clapping a minute and 42 seconds later. I finally opened my eyes to see 
          that everyone had stood up to applaud my build. I had tripled the time of second place as their helicopter only flew for 38 seconds. This was the first time they hadn't placed first in over 7 years and I blew them out of the water. Due to my dedication to the club, I was promoted to head captain for the following year. Without even knowing it, 
          such a little thing had completely changed my life. Soon after, other organizations asked for my help on their builds too which is how I became part of American Society of Civil Engineers. </p><p>I was a Chemistry major that was head captain of Science Olympiad and Secretary of ASCE. Then, I became the treasurer of American Society of Mechanical Engineers 
          and then the president of ASCE. Then, I had the most amazing opportunity and got to be the buisness head of Solar Owls, an organization that was competiting in a national competition with a fully solar powered SUV. After 2 years of being a Chemistry major, I finally switched over to Mechanical Engineering. I went to tons of professional events, got 
          offered several internships and scholarships before I had even turnt 18. I wasn't fully convinced engineering was what I wanted to do in the future but I assumed there was no way I could know what I wanted to do for the rest of my life considering I wasn't even an adult yet. Then, one day, my vice president of ASCE came up to me and said he couldn't 
          find anyone who was willing to take on the coding competition and there was only 2 weeks until the competition. It wasn't required that we competeted in this competition but I knew that I didn't just spend the last year working on a club that had 5 members into one with over 100, just to not compete with full force. Without having ever even seen code 
          before, I decided I was going to take on the competition and I was going to prove how much my club had improved. I had 2 weeks to learn everything about C++ even though I had 7 other competitions that were all happening in that month. I was on the plane to competitions praticing code, I was watching videos while building towers, I was staying up all 
          night trying to do the pratice codes that they had provided us. I finally got to the competition and realized that even though I had two other builds competiting, the one I was most excited for was my coding competition. They ended up cancelling the competition, the night before, due to COVID. I was devestated and left coding alone for a while since 
          I had to handle the precussions of the competition being cancelled. I had an empty class spot about a year later and I decided I would do a coding class for fun. Once again, I realized how much I loved coding, how natural it felt to me, how I could get so carried away with it that I'd forget about everything around me. For another year, I continued to 
          stay in Mechanical Engineering. I had already switched my major and I had so many amazing opportunities lined up for me once I graduated and I didn't want all of my hard work and dedication to those clubs to just be wasted. Then I realized that I had just turned 19 and I still had my entire life ahead of me so I should go after what I wanted and not just
          what was easier. That's when I decided I was going to switch my major again even though everyone protested it. </p> </div>
